module: cntk.logging.progress_print
inheritances:

summary: 'Allows writing various statistics (e.g. loss and metric) to TensorBoard
  event files during training/evaluation.

  The generated files can be opened in TensorBoard to visualize the progress.'
constructor:

  parameters:
  - name: freq
    description: 'frequency at which training progress is written.

      None indicates that progress is logged only at the end of training.

      Must be a positive integer otherwise.'

  - name: rank
    description: 'rank of a worker when using distributed training, or *None* if

      training locally. If not *None*, event files will be created only by rank 0.'
