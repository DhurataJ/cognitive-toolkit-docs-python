  - name: as_numpy
    description: 'whether the data should be automatically

      converted from and to NumPy. Defaults to True. Specifying this as

methods:
- uid: cntk.ops.functions.UserFunction.clone
  name: clone
  summary: 'Creates a clone of this user-defined function.


    It assumes that the constructor signature of the user''s implementation

    of the user function takes the inputs as individual arguments followed

    by the operator name. If the signature is different, then this method

    needs to be overriden.'
