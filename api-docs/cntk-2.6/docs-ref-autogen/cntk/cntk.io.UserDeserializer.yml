summary: "User deserializer is a base class for all user defined deserializers.\n\
  To support deserialization of a custom format, please implement the public\nmethods\
  \ of this class and pass an instance of it to MinibatchSource.\nA UserDeserializer\
  \ is a plug-in to MinibatchSource for reading data in custom formats.\nReading data\
  \ through this mechanism provides the following benefits:\n\n   * randomization\
  \ of data too large to fit into RAM, through CNTK chunked paging algorithm \n\n\
  \   * distributed reading - only chunks needed by a particular worker are requested\
  \ \n\n   * composability of transforms (currently composability of user deserializers\
  \ is not yet supported) \n\n   * transparent support of sequence/frame/truncated\
  \ BPTT modes \n\n   * automatic chunk and minibatch prefetch \n\n   * checkpointing\
  \ \n\nThe MinibatchSource uses the information provided by this class to build the\
  \ timeline and move\nalong it when the next minibatch is requested. The deserializer\
  \ itself, however, is stateless."
